Join us in making Java a great platform for data science
========================================================

Tablesaw makes it easy to use Java for data science, but we can use your help. Here are some ways you can contribute today:

* Ask or answer questions
* Report or fix a bug
* Implement new features and enhancements

## About questions

Please use the project [Issues section on Github](https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw/issues) to ask questions, tagging the issue as a "Question".

## Using Github to implement features and fix bugs

If you want to help out with one of our bugs or implement a new feature, here are some suggestions for success.  The basic process looks like this:

1. Fork Tablesaw
2. Clone your fork to your development machine
3. Create your issue branch
4. Implement your feature or fix the bug and push the results to your fork
5. Send us a pull request.

You can find more info about [creating a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) in the GitHub help articles. Our maintainers will review your pull request as soon as we can. You can find our project on Github at:

[https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw](https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw)

## What makes a good Pull Request?

To summarize:

* Address only one issue with a single pull request.
* For new functionality, have a conversation with one or more maintainers before putting in too much work. Opening an issue is a good way to start the conversation
* Requests with tests are the best
* Finally, We love small pull requests. That we we can find time to review them between work, and family, and watching Game of Thrones.

## What to Contribute?

Among the open bugs and feature requests, we've tagged some as "Help Wanted". This indicates that a fix should be relatively straightforward to address. 

We'd also love to add support for more machine learning algorithms by adding new interfaces to Smile.  Basically, you’re creating methods that transform tables to the format the Smile needs, and wraps the Smile API so that the necessary options can be set through Tablesaw. Some knowledge of machine learning would be helpful

Implement an interface for a Javascript plotting library (big job, we know), but the best Javascript libraries are awesome.
Email larry@tablesaw.tech if you have any questions, or use the comments for the issue.

## Working on the code in Eclipse

* Install e(fx)clipse. Choose the update site that came with your installation of Eclipse. E.g. "Oxygen - http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen". Then install "e(fx)clipse" under "General Purpose Tools"
* [Install Kotlin support](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/getting-started-eclipse.html). Read [this Stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42496708/cant-get-kotlin-classes-in-java-maven-project-to-work-eclipse) for tips on working around bugs in the Kotlin eclipse plugin.

## Become a Maintainer/Committer

We are actively seeking new maintainers for the project. The best way to get involved is to familiarize yourself with the project through use, and make a few minor changes/fixes. After that, introduce yourself by emailing info@tablesaw.tech and we’ll get in touch.
